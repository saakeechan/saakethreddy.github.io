### [Sandia National Labs](https://www.sandia.gov/)
**Position:** R&D Mechanical Engineering Intern  
**Duration:** Summer 2023 & Summer 2024  
**Location:** Livermore, CA 

#### Unfortunately I can't showcase the work for security purposes ####

- Designed 3 unique fixtures for vibration testing of telemetry assemblies. Performed modal & structural analysis in Creo to ensure fixture integrity. Produced machine drawings with GD&T annotations 
- Partnered with Pelican to design and engineer a foam shipping container, safeguarding a multi-million-dollar telemetry assembly from impacts, vibrations, and ESD during transport 
-  Defined end-to-end requirements and test procedures for thermal and lifting-ring strength evaluations of a classified gas detector by thoroughly reviewing and synthesizing numerous DoD test methods and specifications, then designed a compliant test approach from the ground up.
- Automated vibration & shock test data analysis using MATLAB, cutting work time by 75% and saving 20+ hours weekly
