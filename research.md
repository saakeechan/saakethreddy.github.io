### LiDAR-Informed, Terrain-Adaptive Invariant Kalman Filtering for Legged Robots
**Authors:** Saaketh Reddy, Ziwon Yoon  
**Status:** In Progress

This paper presents a terrain-aware invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) that adapts its covariance online using LiDAR-derived terrain information. A neural network maps geometric and structural terrain cues to context-dependent uncertainty adjustments, allowing the estimator to modulate trust in kinematic odometry under varying contact and slip conditions for legged robots.
